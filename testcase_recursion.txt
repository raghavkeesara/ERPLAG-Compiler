<<<driver program>>>
start

end

<<module recur>>
takes input [x:integer];
start	
	x:=3;	
	use module recur with parameters x;
end

**notice that this test case does not declare the module before the driver module, still it is syntactically correct
as moduleDeclarations is optional. Testing whether a module is declared before usage is a matter of semantic analysis**
